            A class used to group multiple mementos together, which can be pushed on to the undo stack as a single memento. 
            With this class, multiple consecutive actions can be recognized as a single action, which are undo as an entity. 
            It also implements the <see cref="T:GenericUndoRedo.IMemento`1"/> interface, which means one <see cref="T:GenericUndoRedo.CompoundMemento`1"/> can be a 
            member of another <see cref="T:GenericUndoRedo.CompoundMemento`1"/>. Therefore it is possible to create hierachical mementos.

            The most generic interface of a memento class. A memento is a state that can be saved and restored.
            See details on <b>Memento Design Pattern</b> concept

            </summary>
            <remarks>
            <b>Design Considerations:</b>
            The common memento struture a state property and sometimes an action property. 
            In this design those properties are not explicitly , though essentially the 
            In this design, if a memento stores a state and doesn't has the ability to Restore the target to the state, 
            we have to introduce another class or a class per type of memento. 
            With the memento itslef supporting Retore of the states, the state and action are not necessary to be exposed as public properties. 
            And only one class for each type of memento is required, which is simpler to read and easier to maintain.
            <b>NOTE</b> that every class that implements this interface should be serializable, 
            by either annotate it with "[Serializabl]" or manuallying implementing the serialization methods. 
            This requirement should be full filled in order to support the serialization of <see cref="T:GenericUndoRedo.UndoRedoHistory`1"/>.

            <returns>A memento of the state before restoring, which is refered to as a <i>Inverse Memento</i> of this memento.</returns>
            <remarks>
            Being able to restore its own state, undo can be implemented using an undo stack. But that's not enough for implementing redo. 
            The returned inverse memento is the key to support redo.

            From the time this method is called till the time 
            <see cref="M:GenericUndoRedo.UndoRedoHistory`1.EndCompoundDo"/> is called, all the <i>DO</i> actions (by calling 
            <see cref="M:GenericUndoRedo.UndoRedoHistory`1.Do(GenericUndoRedo.IMemento{`0})"/>) are added into a temporary 
            <see cref="T:GenericUndoRedo.CompoundMemento`1"/> and this memnto will be pushed into the undo 
            stack when <see cref="M:GenericUndoRedo.UndoRedoHistory`1.EndCompoundDo"/> is called.

            history.Do(memento1);

            // Version 1: With grouping

            hisotry.EndCompoundDo(); // must be called to finish grouping

            <remarks>
            This property is extremely useful to prevent undesired "Do" being executed. 
            That could occur in the following scenario:
            event X causees a Do action and certain Undo / Redo action causes event X, 
            i.e. Undo / Redo causes a Do action, which will render history in a incorrect state.
            So whenever <see cref="M:GenericUndoRedo.UndoRedoHistory`1.Do(GenericUndoRedo.IMemento{`0})"/> is called, the status of <see cref="P:GenericUndoRedo.UndoRedoHistory`1.InUndoRedo"/>
